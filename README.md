# Java-Training
This is where I will put all my training code

The idea behind this, is only use the iPad Pro to code the training material. Using Cloud bases IDEs.

At present GITHUBs CodeSpace is one of the best I've used. Especially as the editor is VSCode. 

There is limits however, the code would need to run in the terminal. It main work for test automation as the code maybe able to open a webpage and testing it.

Watch this space to find out!
